# My first RESTful API using Flask

## installation

```
pip install flask
pip install flask restful
pip install flask_jwt
```
## Description

This is a test RESTful API project made using flask and SQLite3.

The project's use case is of a store management system with many stores and items exclusive to one single store.

Also, user authentication (username & password) is implemented, although it is very rudimentary.

This API uses SQLite3 in a local environment and PostgreSQL in Heroku.
